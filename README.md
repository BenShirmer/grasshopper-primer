##WELCOME
You have just opened the third edition of the Grasshopper Primer. This primer
was originally written by Andrew O. Payne of Lift Architects for Rhino4 and
Grasshopper version 0.6.0007 which, at the time of its release, was a giant
upgrade to the already robust Grasshopper platform. We now find ourselves at
another critical shift in Grasshopper development, so a much needed update to
the existing primer was in order. We are thrilled to add this updated primer to
the many amazing contributions put forth by Grasshopper community members.
With an already excellent foundation from which to build, our team at Mode Lab
went to work designing and developing the look and feel of the third edition.
This revision provides a comprehensive guide to the most current Grasshopper
build, version 0.90076, highlighting what we feel are some of the most exciting
feature updates. The revised text, graphics, and working examples are intended
to teach visual programming to the absolute beginner, as well as provide a quick
introduction to Generative Design workflows for the seasoned veteran. It is our
goal that this primer will serve as a field guide to new and existing users looking
to navigate the ins and outs of using Grasshopper in their creative practice.

##FOUNDATIONS
This primer, titled Foundations, introduces you to the fundamental concepts and
essential skill-building workflows to effectively use Grasshopper. Foundations
is the first volume in a forthcoming collection of Grasshopper primers (to be
released in the coming months). This first volume tracks through an introduction
to the Grasshopper user interface, the anatomy of a Grasshopper definition,
and three chapters dealing with parametric concepts and case study examples.
An appendix closes out this volume, providing you with resources for continued
exploration.
We hope that at the very least this primer will inspire you to begin exploring the
many opportunities of programming with Grasshopper. We wish you the best of
luck as you embark on this journey.

A special thanks to David Rutten for the endless inspiration and invaluable
work pioneering Grasshopper. We would also like to thank Andrew O. Payne
for providing the assets from which this work initiated. Lastly, many thanks to
Bob McNeel and everyone at Robert McNeel & Associates for their generous
support over the years.

##REQUIRED SOFTWARE
**Rhino5**

Rhino 5.0 is the market leader in industrial design modeling software. Highly
complicated shapes can be directly modeled or acquired through 3D digitizers.
With its powerful NURBS based engine Rhino 5.0 can create, edit, analyze, and
translate curves, surfaces, and solids. There are no limits on complexity, degree,
or size.

**Grasshopper**

For designers who are exploring new shapes using generative algorithms,
Grasshopper is a graphical algorithm editor tightly integrated with Rhino’s
3D modeling tools. Unlike RhinoScript or Python, Grasshopper requires no
knowledge of the abstract syntax of scripting, but still allows designers to build
form generators from the simple to the awe inspiring.

##FORUMS
The Grasshopper forum is very active and offers a wonderful resource for
posting questions/answers and finding help on just about anything.
The forum has categories for general discussion, errors & bugs, samples &
examples, and FAQ.

The Common Questions section of the Grasshopper site contains answers to
many questions you may have, as well as helpful links:

##THINGS TO REMEMBER
* Grasshopper is a graphical algorithm editor that is integrated with
Rhino3D’s modeling tools.
* Algorithms are step by step procedures designed to perform an operation.
* You use Grasshopper to design algorithms that then automate tasks in
Rhino3D.
* An easy way to get started if you are unclear how to perform a specific
operation in Grasshopper would be to try manually and incrementally
creating an algorithm using Rhino commands.
