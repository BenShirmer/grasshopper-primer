Now, right click on the download link, and choose Save Target As from the menu. Select a location on your hard drive (note: the file cannot be loaded over a network connection, so the file must be saved locally to your computer’s hard drive) and save the executable file to that address.

>1. Follow the steps in the Installation wizard.

###F.0.0.2 LAUNCHING
To Launch Grasshopper, type Grasshopper into the Rhino Command line. When you launch Grasshopper, the first thing you will see is a new window floating in front of Rhino. Within this window you can create node-based programs to automate various types of functionality in Rhino. Best practice is to arrange the windows so that they do not overlap and Grasshopper does not obstruct the Rhino viewports.
