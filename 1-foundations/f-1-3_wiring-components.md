## F.1.3 WIRING COMPONENTS

#####When data is not stored in the permanent record set of a parameter, it must be inherited from elsewhere. Data is passed from one component to another through wires. You can think of them literally as electrical wires that carry pulses of data from one object to the next.

###F.1.3.0 CONNECTION MANAGEMENT
To connect components, click and drag near the circle on the output side of an object. A connecting wire will be attached to the mouse. Once the mouse hovers over a potential target input, the wire will connect and become solid. This is not a permanent connection until you release the mouse button. It doesn’t matter if we make the connections in a ‘left to right’ or ‘right to left’ manner.

###F.1.3.1 FANCY WIRES
Wires represent the connections as well as the flow of data within the graph in our definition. Grasshopper can also give us visual clues as to what is flowing through the wires. The default setting for these so-called “fancy wires” is off, so you have to enable them before you can view the different types of line types for the connection wires. To do this, simply click on the View Tab on the Main Menu Bar and select the button labeled “Draw Fancy Wires.” Fancy wires can tell you a lot of information about what type of information is flowing from one component to another.

###F.1.3.2 WIRE DISPLAY
If you have spent any great deal of time working on a single Grasshopper definition, you may have realized that the canvas can get cluttered with a nest of wires quite quickly. Fortunately, we have the ability to manage the wire displays for each input of a component.

There are three wire displays: Default Display, Faint Display, and Hidden Display. To change the wire display, simply right-click on any input on a component and select one of the views available under the Wire Display pop out menu.
