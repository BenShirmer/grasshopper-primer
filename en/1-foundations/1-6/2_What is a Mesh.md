## 1.6.2 What is a Mesh?

#####A Mesh is a collection of quadrilaterals and triangles that represents a surface or solid geometry. This section discusses the structure of a mesh object, which includes vertices, edges, and faces, as well as additional characterstics such as colors and normals that can be used to refine a mesh.

####1.6.2.1 Basic Anatomy of a Mesh

At their most basic, meshes are simply a collection of points that are grouped into polygons. The points of a mesh are called *Vertices*, while the polygons are called *Faces*. To define a mesh, then, we need a minimum of two parts:

1. A list of vertices
2. A system of grouping those vertices into faces

**Vertices**

**Faces**
A face is an ordered list of vertices. Grasshopper allows two kinds of faces: Quad Faces and Triangle Faces (Note that some other software only allows triangular faces.
